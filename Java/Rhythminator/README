#Rhythminator

A sound sequencer which plays a sequence of sounds in a rhythmic manner. It uses a set of pre-defined sounds that are
stored in sound files. It displays a grid in which the horizontal row represents notes and the verticle column represents
beats that are listed across the bottom in the yellow boxes. Gray boxes will appear when the user clicked to have that
note/instrument play on that beat.
