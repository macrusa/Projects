#LaserMirrors

Simulates the firing of a laser into a two-dimensional grid (uses 2D arrays) that contains mirrors. The mirrors are 
placed at 45-degree angles to the grid and reflect the laser beam by 90 degrees. The grid is displayed using simple text 
characters. A mirror will be displayed as a forward or backward slash, and a laser beam will be a dash or a vertical 
bar. One can choose to fire from any row by changing the number when the scanner asks for it in the console. Also, the
text character grid can be changed as long as the convention below is folowed.

A left-leaning mirror reflects the laser from a southward direction to an eastward direction or from westward to
