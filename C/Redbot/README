#Redbot

The Redbot uses ADC, PWM, USART and Timers to read values through its sensors to determine how to follow the black tap.

ADC
  Gets the integer values of what the 3 sensors read. Different configurations were needed for sensor1, sensor2, and
  sensor3.
  
PWM, Timers
  Uses PWM and Timers to move the motors of the Redbot. Different configurations were needed for moving forwards,
  moving backgrounds, turning right, and turning left.
  
Algorithm
  Conditional statemnts were used to check where the Redbot was. For example, if it was on a sharp right corner,
  it will read the black tape on its middle and right sensor and therefore, the algorithm can be calculated that way.
  USART was used for debugging purposes when testing to see what the Redbot sensors were reading.
